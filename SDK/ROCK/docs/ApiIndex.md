# V1 function table index

`RockProviderApi` is append-only. The x64 V1 table currently contains 99 function pointers (792 bytes). Slot order is ABI and is mechanically checked against this document.

The signature, enum values, structure defaults, flags, and inline support helpers in `ROCKProviderApi.h` are normative. This index explains intent and the principal gate; it does not replace the header.

## Exports

The provider table has three discovery exports:

- `ROCKAPI_GetDescriptorV1`: preferred safe discovery path.
- `ROCKAPI_GetProviderApi`: legacy provider-table accessor.
- `ROCKAPI_GetApi`: alias returning the same table.

Consumers normally call `RockProviderApi::initialize` instead of resolving these manually.

`GetROCKConfigurationApi` is an independent V1 export with its own version/size
checks and three configuration callbacks. It does not change the 99 provider
slots. See [Configuration.md](Configuration.md).
